Pandas challenge solved
The file suitable for marking is the one named PyCitySchools_starter_final.ipynb
My report is the file named Pandas Challenge Report.
The pace of the class was difficult for me to follow and so a good number of the examples done in class required me to get help to understand them better.
The help I got was instrumental to me being able to in a stepwise fasion successful resolve the challeges.
